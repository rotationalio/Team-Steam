# Problem Statement

Video Games are plentiful and of varied genres, difficulties, lengths, and hardware requirements. Steam's recommendation system, among others, is a powerful tool that assists players in finding games they may enjoy, but we believe that with the currently available data there are more player-oriented methods to improve recommendations. New players may want to visit older games before playing the most recent iteration in a series. Veterans may like to play games they missed on launch and forgot to revisit. Wassi aims to create an AI-powered and interactive recommendation system that guides players through their gaming journey, regardless of where they are starting from. Wassi aims to recommend great games, not just popular ones, to improve players' experience. Wassi will offer to players a variety of choices, not limited to AAA titles, to introduce players to lesser-known studios and contribute to a healthier video game market.
